# Dynamic Schema Comparator

This project provides a tool for comparing database schemas between DB2 and Snowflake. It fetches metadata from both databases, compares the schemas, and generates a detailed comparison report.

## Features

- Fetch metadata from DB2 and Snowflake databases
-Impur Your SRC na TRG QUERY IN THE RESPECTIVE .TXT FILE 
-Dynamic column mapping between DB2 and Snowflake
- Detailed schema comparison
- Excel report generation with highlighted differences

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - snowflake-connector-python
  - openpyxl
  - pyyaml
  - numpy
  - ibm_db (for DB2 connection)

## Data Validation Configuration

This README provides an overview of the data validation configuration settings for a project that compares data between a DB2 source database and a Snowflake target database.

Configuration Details
Source Database (DB2)
Database Type: DB2_SRC
Connection Parameters:
Hostname: [To be filled]
User ID: [To be filled]
Password: [To be filled]
Database Name: [To be filled]
Port: [To be filled]

Target Database (Snowflake)
Snowflake User: [To be filled]
Snowflake Account: [To be filled]
Snowflake Warehouse: [To be filled]
Snowflake Database: [To be filled]
Snowflake Schema: [To be filled]
Snowflake Role: [To be filled]

Additional Settings
Run on S1/S2 Failure: YES

Target Connection 2
DLL Path: D:\Users\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\site-\bin

## Notes

The source database connection details need to be filled in for the validation process to work.
There's a commented-out section for an alternative DB2 target configuration (DB2_TRG) if needed.
Ensure all Snowflake connection details are correctly filled before running the validation.

The 'Run on S1/S2 Failure' setting is set to "YES", which likely means the process will continue even if certain stages fail.
The Target Connection 2 section includes a DLL path, which may be required for specific database drivers or modules.

## Usage

1-Fill in all the empty fields in the configuration file.
2-Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to both the source and target databases.
3-Run your data validation tool using this configuration file.

## Db2-Db2 File is for db2 to db2 comparison
